# Exploring-Reddit-dataset-using-Regular-expressions
In this project, we work with a data set containing the top 1,000 questions users posted to AskReddit in 2015 using Regular expressions in Python.

About dataset:

Reddit is a content and community website where users can submit links, text posts, and other types of content to groups of people with similar interests. These groups are called subreddits, and each one specializes in a particular topic.
For example, AskReddit is a popular subreddit where you can pose questions to the entire Reddit community. Users answer the questions by commenting on them. 

Our data set contains the top 1,000 questions users posted to AskReddit in 2015. Reddit user P_S_Laplace created the data set, which has five columns that appear in the following order:

1.	Title -- The title of the post
2.	Score -- The number of upvotes the post received
3.	Time -- When the post was posted
4.	Gold -- How much Reddit Gold users gave the post
5.	NumComs -- The number of comments the post received

Files in the repository:

-> askreddit_2015.csv - File containing the dataset used in the project.

-> Regular Expressions (AskReddit).py - Python file containing all the pieces of code written.


Note: The coding was done on Dataquest's learning platform and later downloaded into a python file where all the pieces of code have been consolidated. So, Each piece of code may have to be run separately for it to execute properly.
